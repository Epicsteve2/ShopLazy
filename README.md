## Inspiration
We were inspired by one of our members idea, where we all pitched our ideas in a Discord server.

## What it does
There are 2 types of users. One who makes a shopping list, and one who goes out and shops.
The one who makes a shopping list will log in, and start to add items to their cart. Once they have the list that they want, they'll submit the list to the server.

The one who goes shopping will then choose which people they want to shop for. Once they are ready, they will press "Start Shopping!" and is able to take a look at all lists they've chosen and cross out items they've brought

## How I built it
I used Flutter to make the UI. My teammates used Firebase for the login system and backend.

## Challenges I ran into
Knowing which Flutter widgets to use, and which are compatible is quite hard and requires a lot of memorization. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I've created a clean and user-friendly user interface in under 36 hours 

## What I learned
I've learned how to communicate effectively, and how important it is to do so. I've learned how to quickly create UI with Flutter, and learned basic git 

## What's next for ShopLazy
Hopefully the team will work on the backend some more and get it up and functional
